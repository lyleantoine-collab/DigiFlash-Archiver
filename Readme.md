DigiFlash Archiver 
Quiet, boring, reliable digitization tools for turning paper mountains into searchable archives. 

## What It Does 
- Scans old documents with your average home or office scanner.
- Auto-names and organizes files based on date, type, and keywords.
- Runs quality checks and OCR to make sure nothing's missed.
- Backs up everything silently in the background. No drama, no fuss-just gets the job done.

## Getting Started 
1. Scan your docs into a big folder.
2. Run the script (coming soon).
3. Walk away.

Files get handled. 
Retro-inspired, modern under the hood.
